### Setting up Docusaurus

If you haven't already installed Docusaurus, you can do so by following these steps:

1. Install Node.js and npm: Docusaurus requires Node.js and npm to be installed on your system. You can download and install them from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

2. Install Docusaurus globally: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

    ```sh
    npm install -g docusaurus-init
    ```

Alternatively, you can follow the official Docusaurus installation guide available [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs).
