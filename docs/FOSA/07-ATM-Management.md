## ATM Application

---

Members who wish to have ATM access submit applications to the SACCO. Let's go through the process:


- To initiate the ATM application process, you'll need to first enter the member's application details and select the appropriate account. Following this, it's crucial to validate the account balance to ensure it can cover any associated ATM charges. If the balance is sufficient, proceed to send the application for approval. Once approved, proceed to charge the ATM card at the specified fee. Finally, don't forget to notify the member upon successful application completion.

## ATM Linking

---

:::note 
Before linking an ATM to a member's account, ensure the following pre-conditions are met:


- Upload ATM card inventories.
- ATM application should be approved.
- Member should have sufficient balance to cover the charges.
- Physical card should be available.

:::

- Here's how the process unfolds: Initially, the headquarters (HQ) takes charge by uploading the ATM card details and dispatching branch details. Subsequently, the linking request undergoes an approval process. Once approved, the ATM cards are dispatched to the respective branch. Following this, the task shifts to linking the ATM cards to the member's account. This involves selecting the relevant ATM application, charging the member, capturing the card details, and ultimately, linking the card to the member's account. With everything in place, the member can then collect the card, with a PIN issued upon collection for activation.

## ATM Delinking
---

Firstly, ATM delinking involves disconnecting an ATM from the member's account. To initiate this process, you'll need to provide a reason for delinking the ATM. Following this, the process undergoes verification and approvals to ensure the request is legitimate. Once approved, the ATM is disassociated from the memberâ€™s account, completing the delinking process.
