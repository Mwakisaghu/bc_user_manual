> Mpesa Management starts by allowing you to initiate an M-PESA transaction directly within Business Central. You'll need to input all necessary transaction details. Once initiated, the system automatically conducts the float amount replenishment process through account transfer. You'll then be prompted to capture and verify all transaction details. Once everything checks out, the system grants you permission to finalize the transaction, triggering updates to the ledgers. Additionally, the system generates a unique M-PESA transaction code for reference.

Expected outputs include a pop-up alert notifying you when the M-PESA reorder level has been reached. Furthermore, you'll find ledger entries reflecting float replenishment, M-PESA cash deposits, and withdrawals, ensuring comprehensive record-keeping.

- To maintain accuracy and prevent potential issues, the system performs validations to ensure the float account balance never falls below the defined reorder level. This safeguard helps maintain financial stability and efficiency within the system.
