### Reconciliation Process
---
### Understanding the Reconciliation Process
---

When running a reconciliation batch, Business Central generates reconciliation lines for each open bank account ledger entry. Matching these lines with bank statement transactions within the selected date range enables you to proceed with posting the reconciliation. Common discrepancies include:

- Transactions in Business Central not on the bank statement.
- Transactions on the bank statement not in Business Central.
- Matching transactions recorded differently between Business Central and the bank statement.

Addressing these differences is essential before finalizing the reconciliation.

    - This creates a general journal line for the statement amount; select an account type and number. The balancing account type is **Bank Account** with the reconciled bank account number.

### Handling Incorrect Transaction Amounts
---

If a bank statement shows an incorrect transaction amount:

1. **Identify and Mark the Incorrect Transaction**
    - Select the incorrect line on the **Bank Statement Lines** FastTab.
    - Choose **Difference** from the **Type** drop-down list.
    - Confirm deletion of the application with **Yes**.

2. **Adjust the Reconciliation**
    - If the **Total Difference** equals the sum of all **Difference** lines, post the reconciliation.
    - If not, correct the imbalance by adjusting the statement amount or adding a line for the difference.

To add a line for the difference:

1. **Create a New Line**
    - Insert a new line on the **Bank Statement Lines** FastTab.
    - Enter the **Transaction Date**.
    - Choose **Difference** from the **Type** drop-down list.
    - Enter a description and the **Statement Amount**.

These adjustments ensure accurate G/L bank account balances in Business Central.
