### Understanding Depreciation Books
---

- **Single vs. Multiple Depreciation Books:** 
  - Each fixed asset must have at least one depreciation book.
  - Multiple depreciation books are useful when configuring different depreciation methods for a single fixed asset (e.g., one method for legal bookkeeping and another for financial reporting).

- **G/L Integration:** 
  - Typically, only one depreciation book has the G/L integration setting enabled.
  - You can set a default depreciation book on the Fixed Asset Setup page.
