### What is a Fixed Asset?
---

A fixed asset, also known as a capital asset, is a tangible piece of property, plant, or equipment (PP&E) that an organization owns with the intention of long-term use. These assets are distinct from current assets and inventory due to their expected longevity and contribution to revenue generation.

Fixed asset accounting involves meticulous financial tracking of capital assets throughout their lifecycle. This includes:

- **Acquisition**: Adding new assets to your books.
- **Depreciation**: Recording periodic decreases in asset value using various depreciation methods.
- **Revaluation**: Assessing assets for fair market value adjustments.
- **Impairment**: Recognizing declines in value due to specific events.
- **Disposal**: Selling or disposing of assets at the end of their useful life.
