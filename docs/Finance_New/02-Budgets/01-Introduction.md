- **Creating Budget Names:**
  - Establish distinct budget names on the G/L Budgets page to manage multiple budgets within the same time frame.

- **Dimension Setup:**
  - Decide whether to incorporate dimensions into your budgets.

  - Each budget can include up to four additional budget dimensions for detailed analysis.
