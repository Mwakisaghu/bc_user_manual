## Creating Sales Invoices
---

Sales invoices are crucial for recording agreements with customers to sell products under specific delivery and payment terms. You generally have two options: creating a sales order or a sales invoice. However, use a sales order in the following cases:

- **Partial Orders**: When you need to ship only part of an order.
- **Post-Shipping Invoices**: When products are shipped after posting the corresponding sales invoices.
- **Drop Shipments**: For drop shipments where the vendor delivers directly to the customer.

In all other cases, sales orders and invoices function similarly.

## Creating a Sales Invoice
---

### Step 1: Start the Process
---

Use the search feature to search for "Sales Invoices" and select the related link.

### Step 2: Enter Customer Information
---

- **Existing Customer**: Enter their name in the Customer Name field.
- **New Customer**:
  1. Enter the customerâ€™s name.
  2. Confirm registering the new customer.
  3. Select a template for the new customer card, then complete the customer information.
  4. Close the customer card to return to the Sales Invoice page.

### Step 3: Fill in Invoice Details
---

Fill in the required fields on the Sales Invoice page. Hover over a field for a description.

- **Immediate Payment**: If allowed (e.g., via cash or PayPal), enter the Payment Method Code. This records the payment upon posting the invoice.

### Step 4: Add Product/Service Lines
---

In the Lines FastTab, select the type of product, charge, or transaction.

- **Recurring Sales Lines**: For regular orders, choose the Get Recurring Sales Lines action.
- **Product Details**: Enter the product details, quantity, and any discounts. The Line Amount will be calculated automatically.

### Step 5: Final Steps
---

- **Verify Amounts**: Use the Customer Statistics FactBox to verify amounts.
- **Invoice Discounts**: Calculate invoice discounts by selecting the Calculate Invoice Discount action.
- **Post and Send**: Choose the Post and Send action to post and send the invoice. Select the customerâ€™s preferred method for receiving documents.

## Managing Posted Invoices
---

### Finding Posted Invoices
---

View posted invoices in the Posted Sales Invoices list.

### Correcting or Cancelling Invoices
---

- **Unpaid Invoices**: Correct or cancel directly.
- **Paid Invoices**: Create a sales credit memo to reverse the sale.

### Viewing Invoice Details
---

Check statistics, dimensions, and ledger entries related to the invoice. You can also print or send the posted invoice.

## Registering Payments
---

Payments can be registered manually, automatically, or through payment services:

### Manual Registration
---

Use the Register Customer Payments action to mark invoices as paid.

## External Document Numbers
---

Include external document numbers referring to the customerâ€™s system for easy tracking. Set the Ext. Doc. No. Mandatory field if itâ€™s required to post invoices with external document numbers.
