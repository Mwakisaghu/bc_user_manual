## Key Reports in Accounts Receivable
---

- ### Aged Accounts Receivables
---

**Description:** This report provides a detailed breakdown of outstanding amounts with customers, categorized by overdue intervals. It includes both due and not yet due amounts and can be displayed with or without document details. This report is essential for reconciling customer ledgers to the General Ledger (G/L), assuming direct posting to customer posting group receivables accounts is not allowed.

---

- ### Customer Statement
---

**Description:** Generates a customer statement for a specified period. It provides an overview of outstanding amounts and can be used as a payment reminder. The report can show overdue amounts in a separate section and includes an aging band (typically set at 30-day intervals). You can filter the report to show only open entries for the customer by selecting the "Open Items" option in the Statement Style field.

---

- ### Customer - Balance to Date
---

**Description:** Displays open customer ledger entries up to the ending date. Similar to the customer statement but does not indicate if entries are overdue. Note that payments made after the ending date but applied to invoices within the date range will appear in the report.

---

- ### Customer - Trial Balance

**Description:** Shows net changes for customers within the specified date filter, including year-to-date changes for the fiscal year. The report is grouped by customer posting groups and provides a different perspective of the customer ledger compared to the Aged Accounts Receivables report. Ensure accounting periods are set up for accurate fiscal year data.

---

- ### Customer - Detail Trial Balance
---

**Description:** Lists all customer ledger entries within the specified date filter. This report is useful for verifying all entries for a specific customer or conducting internal checks on customer ledgers.

---

- ### Customer - Payment Receipt
---

**Description:** Generates a payment receipt for each customer ledger entry of type Payment. If payments are applied to invoices, the invoices are listed; otherwise, the payment amount is shown as unapplied. This report can be sent to customers who request payment receipt documentation.

---

- ### Customer - Summary Aging

**Description:** A legacy version of an accounts receivable aging report. It is recommended to use the Aged Accounts Receivables report instead.
