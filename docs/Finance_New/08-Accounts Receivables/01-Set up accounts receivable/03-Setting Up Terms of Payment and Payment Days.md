### Terms of Payment
---

Terms of payment define when invoices are due based on the invoice date. These terms are shared between accounts receivable and accounts payable modules, providing consistency across transactions.

#### Configuring Terms of Payment
---

- Navigate to **Accounts receivable > Payments setup > Terms of payment**.
- Define payment terms applicable to your company and customers.
- Assign terms of payment to:
  - **Customers** via the **Customers** page.
  - **Sales orders** on the **Sales order** page.

#### Example Scenario
---

For instance, a company sets a standard Net 30 days payment term. If an invoice is issued on October 1, the payment is due by October 31. Late payments may incur additional charges, ensuring prompt settlement is advantageous.

### Payment Days
---

Payment days specify the specific day of the week or month when payments are due. This setting influences payment scheduling and aids in managing cash flow effectively.

#### Setting Up Payment Days
---

- Go to **Accounts receivable > Payments setup > Payment days**.
- Define payment days numerically (e.g., 15 for the 15th day of the month).
- Utilize payment days to schedule invoices for payment in the customer payment journal.

Properly configuring terms of payment and payment days in Business Central is essential for maintaining financial discipline and ensuring timely payments. By establishing clear payment terms and specifying payment days, organizations can enhance cash flow management and foster better financial health.
