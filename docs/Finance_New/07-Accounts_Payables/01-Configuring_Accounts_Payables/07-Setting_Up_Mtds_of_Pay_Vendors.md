# Setting Up Methods of Payment for Vendors
---

Many companies offer several methods to pay due invoices, such as:

- Credit
- Cash in advance
- Bill of exchange
- Check and electronic payments

Watch this video to learn how to create a method of payment. ðŸ‘‰ 

### Methods of Payment
---
Using the **Methods of payment** page, you can specify all the methods of payment that your company uses to pay vendors. For each method of payment, enter information that states how payments should be summarized and posted. Methods of payment can be assigned to vendors, journals, and purchase orders in the Accounts Payable module.

On the **Methods of payment** page, you can select whether the system should total the invoices in an automatic payment proposal.

**Navigation:** Accounts payable > Payment setup > Methods of payment

### Payment Options
---
The following options are available for how payments are summarized:

- **Invoice:** Creates one payment transfer for each invoice.
- **Date:** Combines the payment for all invoices for vendors with the same due date.
- **Week:** Combines the payment for all invoices for vendors with a due date within the same week.
- **Total:** Combines all invoices from vendors for the same payment.

You can also enter the number of days added to the cash discount date or the due date to define the broadest period in which a cash discount could be obtained. This is done in the **Grace period** field.

### Payment Types
---
You can select the type of payment allowed in the **Payment type** field. The options available are:

- **Other:** The method of payment is none of the other choices or is not yet assigned. This is the default value.
- **Check:** The method of payment is a check.
- **Electronic Payment:** The method of payment is electronic, such as electronic funds transfer (EFT). When this payment type is used, the system performs bank validations that are skipped if you use other payment types.
- **Promissory Note:** The method of payment is a promissory note.

You must enable the **Allow copies of payments** field to allow users to print non-negotiable copies of payments for the selected method of payment. You might need to print copies of payments to resolve payment disputes or to let vendors know which invoices were paid on a particular date.

### Export and Return Formats
You need to specify the format to export payment, for example, a check which informs Finance how to communicate with the bank. This option is called **Export format**.

If the format list is empty, select the **Setup** button and choose from the available file formats.
