### Creating a Payment Fee
---

To create a payment fee, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate** to **Accounts payable > Payment setup > Payment fee**.
   
2. **Create** a new record and specify whether the fee is charged to the Vendor or Ledger in the **Charge** field. If it's charged to the Ledger, select the appropriate **Main account** for ledger posting.

3. Choose a valid **Journal type** where the fee is applicable, typically **Vendor bank remittance**.

### Defining Payment Fee Details
---

When setting up a payment fee, consider the following details:

- **Fee Identification**: Define how the fee is identified and related to specific vendors or transactions.
- **Bank Relations**: Specify which banks or financial institutions apply this fee.
- **Fee Generation**: Define rules for when and how the fee is generated.

You can set up multiple fee lines tailored for different banks, payment methods, currencies, and time periods.

#### Payment Specifications and Currency
---

Specify the payment specifications in the **Payment specification** field and select the currency in which the fee applies in the **Fee currency** field. Choose whether the fee amount is a percentage or an absolute amount in the **Percentage/Amount** field.

### Scenario Example
---

Let's consider ABC Ltd, which uses electronic transfers for vendor invoice payments. After transferring invoice amounts to the bank, they automatically send a remittance advice to each vendor detailing the payment account and amount. To handle bank remittance charges effectively, ABC Ltd decides to set up payment fees in Dynamics 365 Finance.
