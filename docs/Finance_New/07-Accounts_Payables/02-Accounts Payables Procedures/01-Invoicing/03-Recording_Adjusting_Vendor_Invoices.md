### Methods to Enter Vendor Invoices

Several methods are available to enter vendor invoices efficiently:

- **Vendor Invoice Register:** Quickly input invoices not referencing purchase orders to accrue expenses.
- **Vendor Invoice Approval Journal:** Post invoices from the register to vendor balances for accrual adjustments.
- **Vendor Invoice Journal:** Enter invoices directly in one step without purchase order references.
- **Vendor Invoice Pool:** Efficiently enter and accrue invoices, associating them later with specific purchase orders.

1. Navigate to **Accounts payable parameters** page.
