In Business Central, when you post transactions to customers, two main types of customer entries are generated:

Customer entries provide detailed information about customers and sales business. They are generated from sales documents such as sales orders, sales invoices, and journals like cash receipt journals.

2. Choose a customer and open their customer card by selecting the No. field.
3. Select **Related**, then **History**, and finally **Ledger Entries**.
