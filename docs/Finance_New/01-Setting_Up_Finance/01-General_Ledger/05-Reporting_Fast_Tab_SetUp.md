#### Reporting Currency Setup
---

- The Reporting FastTab allows you to configure whether another reporting currency is used alongside the local currency. This is necessary when transaction information needs to be available in a currency other than the local currency.

- When another reporting currency is set up, users can generate financial reports in both the local currency and the reporting currency.

#### Account Schedules Setup
---

Additionally, you can specify account schedules for the following reports:

- Balance Sheet
- Income Statement
- Cash Flow Statement
- Retained Earnings Report


---
To generate these account schedules:

1. Select the **Search for Page** icon in the upper-right corner of the page.
2. Enter **G/L account categories** and select the related link.
3. Navigate to **Process > Generate Account Schedules**.

These account schedules are based on G/L account categories and subcategories. Ensure that all G/L accounts have correct categories and subcategories assigned before generating these account schedules.
